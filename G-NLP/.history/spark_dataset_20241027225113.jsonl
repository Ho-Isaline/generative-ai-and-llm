{"prompt": "What are Spark partitions?", "completion": "Partitions are logical divisions of data in Spark. They define the unit of parallelism, with each partition being processed by a single task."}
{"prompt": "How does Spark support streaming data?", "completion": "Spark Streaming divides real-time data streams into small batches and processes them using Spark’s batch processing model."}

{"prompt": "What is a shuffle operation in Spark?", "completion": "A shuffle operation redistributes data across partitions, which can be an expensive operation. It is required by operations like join, groupByKey, and reduceByKey."}
{"prompt": "What is the difference between cache() and persist() in Spark?", "completion": "cache() stores RDDs in memory for faster access, while persist() offers flexibility to store RDDs in memory, disk, or both, depending on the specified storage level."}
{"prompt": "What is a task in Spark?", "completion": "A task is a unit of work sent to a Spark executor. Each task operates on a single partition of data, processing it and returning results to the driver."}
{"prompt": "How does Spark's in-memory processing work?", "completion": "Spark keeps data in memory by caching RDDs, allowing faster access to intermediate results during processing, which reduces the need for disk I/O."}

{"prompt": "What is Spark's fault tolerance mechanism?", "completion": "Spark's fault tolerance relies on lineage graphs and recomputing lost data based on the transformations applied to RDDs or DataFrames, rather than replicating data across nodes."}

{"prompt": "What is the default storage level for cache() in Spark?", "completion": "The default storage level for cache() in Spark is MEMORY_ONLY, which stores RDD data in memory only, discarding partitions that do not fit."}
{"prompt": "What are Spark Jobs, Stages, and Tasks?", "completion": "A job is triggered by an action, which is split into stages based on shuffle boundaries. Each stage is further divided into tasks that are executed on partitions."}
