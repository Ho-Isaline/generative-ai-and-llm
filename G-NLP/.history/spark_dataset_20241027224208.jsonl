{"prompt": "What is the purpose of the SparkContext?", "completion": "The SparkContext is the entry point to any Spark functionality, allowing the program to access Spark's resources and create RDDs, accumulators, and broadcast variables."},
{"prompt": "How does Spark handle machine learning?", "completion": "Spark has a machine learning library called MLlib, which provides scalable algorithms for common tasks like classification, regression, clustering, and recommendation."},
{"prompt": "What is a Spark DAG?", "completion": "A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) in Spark represents the series of stages to execute a job. It tracks dependencies between RDDs and optimizes execution plans for efficient processing."},
{"prompt": "What is Spark Streaming?", "completion": "Spark Streaming enables real-time data processing by dividing continuous data streams into small batches for processing using Spark’s core functionalities."},
{"prompt": "What are Spark DataFrames?", "completion": "DataFrames in Spark are a distributed collection of data organized into named columns. They are similar to tables in a relational database and support a wide range of operations for data manipulation."},
{"prompt": "How to create an RDD in Spark?", "completion": "You can create an RDD by loading an external dataset or parallelizing an existing collection in your driver program using the SparkContext's parallelize() method."},
{"prompt": "What is a transformation in Spark?", "completion": "A transformation is an operation on an RDD that produces a new RDD. Examples include map, filter, and reduceByKey. Transformations are lazily evaluated, meaning they are not executed until an action is called."},
{"prompt": "What is an action in Spark?", "completion": "An action triggers the execution of all transformations on an RDD and returns a value to the driver program. Examples include collect, count, and saveAsTextFile."},
{"prompt": "What is lazy evaluation in Spark?", "completion": "Lazy evaluation means that Spark does not immediately execute transformations but instead waits until an action is called. This allows Spark to optimize the processing by grouping operations into stages."},
{"prompt": "What is a SparkSession?", "completion": "A SparkSession is the main entry point to Spark functionality and is used to create DataFrames, register DataFrames as tables, execute SQL queries, and access various Spark services."},
{"prompt": "What is the use of SparkConf?", "completion": "SparkConf is used to configure a Spark application. It allows setting various Spark parameters, including application name, master URL, and other configurations."},
{"prompt": "What are accumulators in Spark?", "completion": "Accumulators are variables used to aggregate information across executors in Spark. They are useful for counting events or tracking statistics in a distributed environment."},
{"prompt": "What are broadcast variables in Spark?", "completion": "Broadcast variables allow the SparkContext to cache a read-only variable on each machine rather than shipping a copy with tasks, reducing communication costs."},
{"prompt": "What is the difference between cache() and persist() in Spark?", "completion": "Both cache() and persist() are used to store RDDs in memory for faster access. However, persist() allows specifying storage levels (e.g., MEMORY_ONLY, DISK_ONLY), while cache() defaults to MEMORY_ONLY."},
{"prompt": "What are the storage levels in Spark?", "completion": "Storage levels in Spark define how RDDs are stored (e.g., MEMORY_ONLY, MEMORY_AND_DISK, DISK_ONLY). They allow fine-tuning of memory and disk usage for RDD storage."},
{"prompt": "What is Spark MLlib?", "completion": "Spark MLlib is Spark’s machine learning library, providing scalable algorithms for common tasks like classification, regression, clustering, and recommendation."},
{"prompt": "How does Spark handle streaming data?", "completion": "Spark Streaming divides the incoming data into small batches and processes each batch using Spark’s core functionalities, enabling real-time stream processing."},
{"prompt": "What is a Spark job?", "completion": "A Spark job is a parallel computation consisting of multiple tasks that execute a specific set of operations on an RDD or DataFrame."},
{"prompt": "What are Spark tasks?", "completion": "A task in Spark is the smallest unit of execution. Each stage of a Spark job is divided into tasks, each of which processes a portion of the data on an executor."},
{"prompt": "What is a partition in Spark?", "completion": "A partition is a smaller chunk of an RDD or DataFrame, allowing Spark to process data in parallel. The number of partitions can be configured for better performance."},
{"prompt": "How to control the number of partitions in Spark?", "completion": "You can control the number of partitions in Spark by using the repartition() or coalesce() methods, or by setting the number of partitions during data loading."},
{"prompt": "What is a shuffle in Spark?", "completion": "A shuffle is a data redistribution process in Spark that happens when operations like groupByKey or reduceByKey are called. Shuffles are costly in terms of performance and should be minimized."},
